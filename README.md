# WebProject

Bullhorn is a website that allows users to post messages to each other. Each message is limited to 141 characters. Messages do not
contain images. When messages are posted the userâ€™s Gravatar is posted next to the message. Clicking on the Gravatar will take one 
to the public profile for the user. Users clicking on their own image can edit their profile. Bootstrap site design is enhanced to
make it responsive. That means is displays well on any size device. The site will include navigation bars, tables, headers, images,
and other common features found in the latest websites.

Users can read all messages by all users even without logging into the site. Users who log in to the site can also post messages 
and edit their own profile.

All posts and user data will be stored in an Oracle database. The application will access the database using JPA allowing the 
developer to switch databases without rewriting code.

Bullhorn will be developed using Java 7 and using Java features such as JPA and JSTL (Java Standard Tag Library) and EL 
(Expression Language) to standardize and simplify the Java Server Pages (JSPs).

It will use Oracle Database 12c.

The Bullhorn site will introduce us to servlets as well. We'll learn how to communicate between servlets and html forms on JSPs or 
other servlets. We'll learn how to pass objects between pages of a web application and how to make the web application maintain 
state using sessions and cookies.

We will develop all our web pages to be HTML5 compliant and explore frameworks for making it easy for developers to create nice 
looking UI (user interface) even if they have no artistic ability.
